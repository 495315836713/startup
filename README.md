# Welcome

You will learn a lot of things in your technical career: Some things that you will carry forward job-to-job, and some that will you never encounter again.
This guide will have a bit of both, but the purpose is to get you going. 


#### Assumptions: 
1. You are on a Windows Computer. You can use an Apple or Linux computer to do all of this, you will just need to make the changes needed for your OS.

#### Tools needed:
1. You will need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) installed.
2. You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
3. You will need to have [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.

Once all these applications you should move to Module 1.
